##Overview of the project 

PROJECT : Predictive Modling with Linear Regression

OBJECTIVE : Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. 
Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, 
evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. 
Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy .

Key Activities in the Implementation

1) Dataset Creation:
Generate a dataset with a linear relationship between independent variable 𝑋and dependent variable 𝑦.

2) Data Splitting:
Use train_test_split to divide the dataset into training and testing subsets (80% training, 20% testing).

3) Model Training:
Instantiate a LinearRegression model.
Train the model using the training dataset (𝑋_train and  y_train).

4) Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict target values (𝑦_pred) on the test dataset (X_ test).

5) Model Evaluation:
Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Compute R-squared (R²) to determine how well the regression line fits the data.

6) Visualization:
Plot the regression line against the actual data points to visualize the fit.
Create a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values with a perfect prediction line to evaluate accuracy.

7) Result Interpretation:
Use the metrics and visualizations to assess the performance and reliability of the model.
